mass: The only mandatory parameters is mass, which is the object's mass in kg. A 0 as a value will create a static impostor - good for floors.
friction: is the impostor's friction when colliding against other impostors.
restitution: is the amount of force the body will "give back" when colliding. A low value will create no bounce, a value of 1 will be a very bouncy interaction.
nativeOptions: is a JSON with native options of the selected physics plugin. More about it in the advanced tutorial.
