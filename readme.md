 Web browser does not run with nodejs but html javascript build for web game.

Required:

 Please note there are other softwares and packages that current need to run for headless server.

Gulp current work in progress as testing builds.

Install Packages:
 * npm install
 * npm install gulp -g

Type gulp in the current command line. Make sure you install '-g' for global execute run build. For develop build.

Run CMD:
 * npm run dev (run server dev change on files)
 * npm run wbabel (run browser dev changes on files)
 * npm start (compile/build javascript && run server)

Why run on npm instead of node is simple that it just development run test and it run in better babel es6 script that it can't run node it need to be compile.
